Nosecone
The goal of the nose cone is to reduce drag because it streamlines the rocket and allows air to flow smoothly around the body during flight. By minimizing air resistance, the nose cone improves aerodynamic efficiency, increases stability, and helps the rocket travel higher and faster. It also reduces turbulence and pressure buildup at the front of the rocket, which decreases energy loss as the rocket moves through the atmosphere

Changes made to nose cone:
- Good ratio for top to bottom diameter is 10 to 3.27
- When printing, print walls extra thick then sand to avoid issues with how 3d printer creates lines and that's why we're making it 9
- today we found cd (coefficient of drag) => velocity and shape affect it, cadded the nose cone and put it in ansys to find it

an mp4 is attached to show pathlines around it, we had calculated the most efficient shape possible and simulated it
Also attatched is a 3D file for an ellipsoid shaped cone
